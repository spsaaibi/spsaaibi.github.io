This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



{% highlight r %}
summary(cars)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
{% endhighlight %}

You can also embed plots, for example: 


![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](/knitr-lanyon/figure/source/2015-12-12-sample-post/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png) 

<p class = "figcaption">Here is a plot for you.</p>

The border around the graph above is due to custom CSS for this site (see `public/css/custom.css`).  The caption was produced with some HTML:

> `<p class = "figcaption">Here is a plot for you.</p>`

You can write mathematics, of course, but the syntax will be a bit different from R Markdown.  Here's some inline math:  $$ \pi/2 \approx 1.57 $$.  There is displayed math as well:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$

Here's the source so you can see how the above worked:


{% highlight r %}
