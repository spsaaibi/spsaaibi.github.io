This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example: 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

<p class = "figcaption">Here is a plot for you.</p>

The border around the graph above is due to custom CSS for this site (see `public/css/custom.css`).  The caption was produced with some HTML:

> `<p class = "figcaption">Here is a plot for you.</p>`

You can write mathematics, of course, but the syntax will be a bit different from R Markdown.  Here's some inline math:  $$ \pi/2 \approx 1.57 $$.  There is displayed math as well:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$

Here's the source so you can see how the above worked:

```{r eval = FALSE}
