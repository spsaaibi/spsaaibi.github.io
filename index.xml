      <description>&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliquam tincidunt mauris eu risus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn&amp;rsquo;t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;header-level-2&#34;&gt;Header Level 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>
      <link>/post/2016-12-30-hello-markdown/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post written in plain Markdown (&lt;code&gt;*.md&lt;/code&gt;) instead of R Markdown (&lt;code&gt;*.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;). The major differences are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (&lt;code&gt;```{r}&lt;/code&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A plain Markdown post is rendered through &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/&#34;&gt;Blackfriday&lt;/a&gt;, and an R Markdown document is compiled by &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://pandoc.org&#34;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown. For example, you can write a task list with Blackfriday but not with Pandoc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&#34;task-list&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; checked disabled class=&#34;task-list-item&#34;&gt; Write an R package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; disabled class=&#34;task-list-item&#34;&gt; Write a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; disabled class=&#34;task-list-item&#34;&gt; &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; disabled class=&#34;task-list-item&#34;&gt; Profit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Blackfriday does not support LaTeX math and Pandoc does. I have added the MathJax support to this theme (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme&#34;&gt;hugo-lithium-theme&lt;/a&gt;) but there is a caveat for plain Markdown posts: you have to include inline math expressions in  a pair of escaped parentheses &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;( \)&lt;/code&gt; instead of dollar signs &lt;code&gt;$ $&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;\(S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\)&lt;/code&gt;. For R Markdown posts, you can use &lt;code&gt;$ $&lt;/code&gt; to write inline math expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a new post, you have to decide whether the post format is Markdown or R Markdown, and this can be done via the &lt;code&gt;rmd&lt;/code&gt; argument of the function &lt;code&gt;blogdown::new_post()&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;blogdown::new_post(&amp;quot;Post Title&amp;quot;, rmd = FALSE)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn&amp;rsquo;t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliquam tincidunt mauris eu risus.&lt;/li&gt;
