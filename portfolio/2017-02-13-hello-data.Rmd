**2017-02-17** Welcome! I decided to revamp my blog about Machine Learning, AI and Data Science in the real word. This time, I used [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/). This was a breeze thanks to all the work from [Yihui](https://yihui.name/) as well as the helpful blogposts from [Amber](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/) and [Robert](http://robertmyles.github.io/2017/02/01/how-to-make-a-github-pages-blog-with-rstudio-and-hugo/). And now, for the journey!
